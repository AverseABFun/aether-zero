# aether-zero
A work-in-progress custom microcontroller licensed under the TAPR Open Hardware License ([tapr.org/OHL]()) and kept fully open source, forever.

The schematic for Revision 0.2(not the Gerber file) is in `/SCH_Aether Zero_R0.2.json` as an EasyEDA file, which you can open at [https://easyeda.com/editor]() and if enough people want it I will provide it in other formats.
